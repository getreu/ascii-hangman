// excerpt-begin

Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players.  One player
thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by
suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses. In this
version for children the computer selects a word, phrase or sentence randomly
out of a word-list defined in a configuration file. 
// excerpt-end

In the course of the game
ASCII-Art images - designed for children - are progressively disclosed. There
are 30 built in ASCII-Art images from which one is chosen randomly at the
beginning of the game. Alternatively own ASCII-Art can be provided in the
configuration file.

== Play the game 

The game is designed for classroom usage, but can be played alone as well.

=== Classroom requirements

*  Big screen or projector

*  Windows or Linux Computer with `ascii-hangman.exe` or `ascii-hangman` 
   binary installed.

=== Prepare a configuration file with secret words

The aim of the game is to consolidate recently learned vocabulary. 
For this purpose the class composes a vocabulary list of words or expressions,
hereafter referred to as list of secrets words.

*  The class composes the list of secrets together with the teacher. 
   To optimize the learning progress, it is most useful to involve the pupils 
   in the preparation of the list of secrets, e.g.:
   One pupil types the suggested words into the configuration file, the others
   follow at the screen and correct spelling mistakes. 

*  The list of secrets can be recent vocabulary or calculation exercises. A
   secret is always encoded as one line in the configuration file and can be a
   word or a whole sentence of vocabulary or even a math exercise.

*  To give an additional hint it, is possible to tag a part of the secret
   sentence. This part will be disclosed immediately when the game starts.   

*  When the game starts the computer will choose one secret of the list
   randomly. The teacher can play also as he does not know the next secret
   either. Every secret appears only once, unless it is not guessed
   correctly. Then it will appear again at some random time in the future.

=== Game rules

The following rules make sure that the whole class participates.  

1. The whole class is asked to write down all guessed letters on a sheet of 
   paper.

2. A player can guess again when when the last guess was right, meaning the
   secret contained the guessed letter.

3. If not, the next player may try it. In bigger groups the next player should
   be chosen randomly. This incites the whole group as nobody knows who will 
   be the next.

4. A player is not allowed to ask others to remind him if a letter was already
   tried or not. He has to solely rely on his own notes.

5. The winner of the game it the person who discloses the last letter of the
   secret word.


Alternatively, the game can be played in a more disorganized manner:  In order
to activate a group, choose a game master who will type the letters the 
group calls in.

=== Start the game

==== Linux

1. Open a terminal

2. Navigate to a folder containing configuration files, e.g.
  
     cd vocabulary-chapter-1

3. If the folder contains only one configuration file `hangman-words.txt`
just type

     hangman
+
otherwise type, e.g.

     hangman words-page3.txt words-page5.txt

==== Windows

1. Open the folder where the `ascii-hangman.exe` file resides.

2. Open a second explorer window and navigate to a folder with a configuration
file.

3. Drag and drop one or more configuration files on `ascii-hangman.exe`.
