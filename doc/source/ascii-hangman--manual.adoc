// excerpt-begin
_ASCII-Hangman_ is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players.
One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it
by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses.
_ASCII-Hangman_ is a variant of the game especially designed for children: the
computer selects a word, phrase or sentence randomly out of a word-list defined
in a configuration file.
// excerpt-end

In the course of the game, ASCII-Art images - designed for children - are
progressively disclosed. There are more than 300 built in ASCII-Art images from
which one is chosen randomly at the beginning of the game. Alternatively own
ASCII-Art can be provided in the configuration file.

Highlights:

- simple, non distracting user interface,
- setting up word lists is part of the learning process,
- visual non distracting reward system with 50 built-in ASCII-art images,
- no built in traditional gallows image,
- designed for group learning in classroom,
- fully configurable:
  * design own ASCII-art (depending on the learning subject) and associate it
    to a word list,
  * provide the user with hints by disclosing some characters from the start,
- web-application: play without installation,
- desktop versions: play without network access,
- open source software: guaranteed availability, always free of charge.

== Getting started

=== ASCII-Hangman installation

The web-app version does not need to be installed on your computer. Just
navigate to
https://blog.getreu.net/projects/ascii-hangman/web-app/[ASCII-Hangman Web-App]
and start playing.

As far as the desktop version is concerned, there is no installation in the
proper sense either, as the whole application consists of only one binary file.
Download this file here:
https://blog.getreu.net/projects/ascii-hangman/#distribution[ASCII-Hangman
Desktop App] and just execute it.

=== ASCII-Hangman invocation: how to start the game

==== Web-App

Navigate to https://blog.getreu.net/projects/ascii-hangman/web-app[ASCII-Hangman-Web-App].


==== Linux

1. Open a terminal.

2. Navigate to a folder containing configuration files, e.g.

     cd vocabulary-chapter-1

3. If the folder contains only one configuration file named `hangman-words.txt`
   just type:

     ascii-hangman
+
otherwise type, e.g.:

     ascii-hangman words-page3.txt

==== Windows

1. Open the folder in which the `ascii-hangman.exe` executable file resides.

2. Open a second explorer window and navigate to a folder with a configuration
   file, e.g. `hangman-words`.

3. Drag and drop one or more configuration files on `ascii-hangman.exe`.




== ASCII-Hangman configuration

_ASCII-Hangman_ needs a custom list of secrets it can choose secrets to let the
user guess.  This list is provided by a configuration file with a very simple
syntax explained below. When you start the desktop version for the first time,
a sample configuration file, named `ascii-hangman-words.txt`, is created.
Adding own secrets to this file can be done with any text editor. Next time
_ASCII-Hangman_ starts, it will read the modified list of secrets.

The Web-App version of _ASCII-Hangman_ works similar. Here the program starts
with a configuration page allowing you to enter the list of secrets directly
without external editor. If you wish, you can download a prepared list of
secrets from a file on your disk. Note, it is possible to select more than one
file in the file selector dialogue.


=== Linux configuration

. Run _ASCII-Hangman_ once. It creates a configuration file
  `ascii-hangman-words.txt` in the current working directory.

. Edit the configuration file

 nano ascii-hangman-words.txt

. Start the game

 ./ascii-hangman


=== Windows configuration

. Generate a configuration file in your working directory
+
Double click on `ascii-hangman.exe`
+
This creates the file `ascii-hangman_words.txt`

. Edit the configuration file
+
Double-click on `ascii-hangman-words.txt`. This opens the file in the `Notepad`
editor. Add own secrets, one per line.

. Start the game
+
Double-click on `ascii-hangman.exe`.


=== Synopsis and syntax

Newer versions of _ASCII-Hangman_ expect their configuration file in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML[YAML] format. However, when _ASCII-Hangman_
does not find the word `secrets:` at the beginning of the document, it falls
back into some backward-compatibility mode, where it tries to parse the file
according to the former proprietary format. This way you can continue using
your old configuration files without modification.

=== Sample configuration files

==== Simple configuration file

----
secrets:
- guess me
- hangman
- good luck
- 3*7=21
----

==== Simple configuration file with hints

----
secrets:
- guess me
- hang_man_
- _der Hund_| the dog
- _good l_uck
- _3*_7_=21_
----

==== Configuration file with custom image

A configuration file may contain a custom image. The image is gradually
disclosed after each right guess.

----
secrets:
- _guess_ me
- hang_man_
- good luck
- _3*_7_=21_

image: |1
      !!!!\\\\
    '`!_  ||||
     ` \`-'''|
       `\   /
        )\  \
 ejm   /  \  \
           \|

# Author: ejm
----

IMPORTANT: ASCII-art lines must start with at least one (invisible) space character.

It is also possible to split the word list and the image into two files and load
them separately:

      ascii-hangman wordlist.txt custom-image.txt

==== Configuration file with traditional gallows image

The following image has a different rewarding mode: The image is gradually
disclosed after each lost life.

----
secrets:
- _guess _me
- hang_man_
- _good l_uck

traditional: true
image: |1
  ______
  |    |
  |    O
  |   /|\
  |    |
  |   / \
__|_____
|      |___
|_________|
----

Note: The gallows image is not part of the built-in ASCII-art. If wished for,
it can be provided through the configuration file.


== Play the game in the classroom

The game is designed for classroom usage, but can be played alone as well.

=== Classroom requirements

*  Bigger screen or projector

*  Browser with Internet access - or -

*  Windows or Linux Computer with the `ascii-hangman.exe` (Windows) or
   `Ascii-Hangman` (MacOs and Linux) binary installed.

=== Prepare a configuration file with secret words

The following may serve as a suggestion how to integrate the game in
a lesson in class:

The aim of the game is to consolidate recently learned vocabulary.
For this purpose the class composes a vocabulary list of words or expressions,
hereafter referred to as list of secrets words.

*  The class composes the list of secrets together with the teacher.
   To optimize the learning progress, it is most useful to involve the pupils
   in the preparation of the list of secrets, e.g.:
   One pupil types the suggested words into the configuration file, the others
   follow on the screen and correct spelling mistakes.

*  The list of secrets can be recent vocabulary or even some simple calculation
   exercises. A secret is always encoded as one line in the configuration file.
   This can be a word or a whole sentence or expression.

*  To give an additional hint it, is possible to tag some letters of the secret
   sentence (see examples above). This part will be disclosed immediately when
   the game starts.

*  At the beginning of the game, the computer chooses randomly one secret
   out of the list. When a secret is guessed correctly, it will not be asked
   again. The game ends, when all secrets are guessed correctly.


=== Suggested game rules for the classroom

The following rules are designed to stimulate the participation of the
whole group of learners. Vary them according to your needs.

1. Each pupil is asked to write down all already guessed letters on a sheet of
   paper.

2. A player is allowed to guess once more, when the last guess was right.


3. When he fails, he passes the turn to the next player. In bigger groups the
   next player may be chosen randomly. This keeps more pupils concentrated,
   as nobody knows who will be the next.

4. A player is not allowed to ask others what letters are guessed already.
   He has to solely rely on his own notes.

5. The winner of the game is the player who discloses the last letter of the
   secret word.


Alternatively, as activation activity, the game can be played in a more
disorganized manner: First the group chooses a game master.  he will then type
in the guesses the group calls in loudly.


== Data privacy statement

All desktop versions of _ASCII-Hangman_ run locally on your computer and do not
collect or transfer any data.

This applies to the web application version of _ASCII-Hangman_ also: due to its
Web-Assembly-technology, the program runs - once started - entirely in your
Web-Browser's sandbox and never connects to the Internet.
