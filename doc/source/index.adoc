Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players.  One player
thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by
suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses. In this
version for children the computer selects a word, phrase or sentence randomly
out of a word-list defined in a configuration file. 
// excerpt-end

In the course of the game
ASCII-Art images - designed for children - are progressively disclosed. There
are 30 built in ASCII-Art images from which one is chosen randomly at the
beginning of the game. Alternatively own ASCII-Art can be provided in the
configuration file.

== Play the game 

The game is designed for classroom usage, but can be played alone as well.

=== Classroom requirements

*  Screen or projector

*  Windows or Linux Computer with `hangman.exe` or `hangman` binary installed.

=== Prepare a configuration file with secret words

The aim of the game is to consolidate recently learned vocabulary. 
For this purpose the class composes a vocabulary list of words or expressions,
hereafter referred to as secret words words.

*  The class composes the list of secret words together with the teacher.  One
   pupil types the suggested words into the configuration file, the others
   follow at the screen and correct spelling mistakes. 

*  The list of secrets can be recent vocabulary or calculation exercises. A
   secret can be one word only, a whole expression or a sentence.

*  As a hint it is possible to tag a part of the secret sentence. This part
   will be disclosed immediately when the game starts.   

*  When the game starts the computer will choose one secret of the list randomly.
   Even the teacher does not know.


=== Game rules

The following rules make sure that the whole class participates.  

1. The whole class is asked to write down all guessed letters on a sheet of 
   paper.

2. A player can guess again when the secret word contained the guessed letter.

3. If not, the next player may try it. In bigger groups the next player should
be chosen randomly.

4. A player is not allowed to ask others to remind him if a letter was already
   tried or not. He has to solely rely on his notes.

5. The winner of the game it the person who discloses the last letter of the
   secret word.
