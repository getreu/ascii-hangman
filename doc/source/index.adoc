Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players.  One player
thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by
suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses. In this
version for children the computer selects a word, phrase or sentence randomly
out of a word-list defined in a configuration file. In the course of the game
ASCII-Art images - designed for children - are progressively disclosed. There
are 10 built in ASCII-Art images from which one is chosen randomly at the
beginning of the game. Alternatively own ASCII-Art can be provided in the
configuration file.
