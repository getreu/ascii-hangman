### This is a sample word-list for the hangman game

### Sample word-list
#   ----------------
#
# Before every game one line is randomly chosen.
# Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
# Lines with guessing strings must start with '-'.
# Words enclosed with * are not hidden when the game starts:
#   - *guess *me
# shows in the game:
#   g u e s s   _ _
#

- *guess* me
- hang*man*
- good luck


# Lines starting with ':' are game modifier. They change
# the logic how the image is progressively disclosed:
#   ':success-rewarding'       Every guessed character shows a bit more of the
#                              image. This mode is default.
#   ':traditional-rewarding'   Every lost live discloses a bit more of the
#                  image. Choose this mode together with a
#                              traditional gallows image (not built in).


### Sample custom image
#   -------------------
#
# Instead of built in images a word list can use a
# custom image. Lines starting with '|' are interpreted
# as image-lines. Delete '#' in the following lines to
# try out this feature.

:success-rewarding
